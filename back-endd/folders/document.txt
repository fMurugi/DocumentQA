  Early History: •Kenya has a rich history that dates back to prehistoric times. Archaeological findings  suggest that the region was inhabited by early human ancestors, including Homo habilis and  Homo erectus. •The Swahili coast, along Kenya's eastern shoreline, was a center for trade and cultural  exchange between the African interior and the Arab world from the 8th century onwards. Colonial Era: •In the late 19th century, European colonial powers, particularly the British, began to  establish control over various regions in Africa, including what is now Kenya. •Kenya became a British protectorate in the late 19th century and was later declared a British  colony in 1920. •The colonial period saw significant changes in Kenyan society, including the introduction of  cash crops, such as tea and coffee, and the construction of the Kenya-Uganda railway. Mau Mau Rebellion: •The mid-20th century witnessed the Mau Mau Uprising (1952-1960), a violent struggle for  Kenyan independence against British colonial rule. The Mau Mau rebels, primarily drawn  from the Kikuyu ethnic group, demanded land and freedom from British oppression. •The rebellion was met with a brutal response from British colonial authorities, resulting in  widespread human rights abuses and violence. •In 1963, Kenya gained independence from Britain, with Jomo Kenyatta becoming the  country's first Prime Minister and later its first President. Post-Independence Era: •Following independence, Kenya faced various challenges, including political and ethnic  tensions. The government adopted a one-party system, which lasted until the early 1990s. •In 2002, Kenya experienced a peaceful transition of power when President Daniel arap Moi  stepped down, and Mwai Kibaki was elected as the new President. Modern Kenya: •Kenya is known for its vibrant economy and diverse culture. Nairobi, the capital city, is a  major economic and political hub in East Africa. •The country has made significant progress in education, healthcare, and infrastructure  development. It has also become a popular tourist destination, known for its national parks  and wildlife.
